# Hi there 👋 I'm Mitun 

🚀 **Engineer | Computer Vision & Robotics | Embedded AI**

I’m passionate about turning complex ideas into real-world solutions. From building hardware and robotics projects in my undergrad to developing real-time AI pipelines on embedded platforms during my master’s, I bridge **deep learning research** with **practical deployment**.

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, C, C++, Rust, MATLAB, SQL  
- **AI/ML:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, ONNX, TensorRT  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, YOLO, Detectron2, MediaPipe, FiftyOne, CVAT  
- **MLOps & Tools:** MLflow, DVC, Docker, GitHub Actions, FastAPI  
- **Embedded & Robotics:** NVIDIA Jetson, ROS2, Arduino, Raspberry Pi  

### 📌 Featured Projects
- 🧠 [Nuclei Segmentation Pipeline](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:oulu-202506164608) – Modular detection + segmentation pipeline using YOLO, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and SAM.  
- 🤖 [ROS2 Face Landmark Detection](https://github.com/mitunkantipaul/ros2_ws) – Real-time vision system on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano using ROS2, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.  
- 🚗 [Driver Drowsiness Detection](https://github.com/akashshingha850/affective_computing_project_2024) – Edge-deployed PyTorch pipeline with ONNX/TensorRT optimization running at 70 FPS.  
- 📊 [Retail Analytics with Spark](https://github.com/akashshingha850/Big-Data-Processing-2024)– Big data pipeline for 2M+ sales records, predictive analytics, and visualization.
